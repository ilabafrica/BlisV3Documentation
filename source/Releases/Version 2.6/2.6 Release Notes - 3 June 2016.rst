**Instructions**

**Requirements**

#. Supported database. Currently only `MySQL <http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>`_ has been tested. Laravel also supports PostgreSQL, SQLite and SQL Server
#. `PHP <http://php.net/>`_ (>= 5.4)
#. `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ - Dependency manager for PHP

**Quick Start**

#. Install the above mentioned requirements
#. Download this git repository to a local folder: `https://github.com/ilabafrica/iBLIS/archive/2.6.zip <https://github.com/ilabafrica/iBLIS/archive/2.6.zip>`_
#. Change directory to the root folder of the application. Update composer then run it in order to install the application dependencies. You may need root permissions to update composer.::

	composer self-update
	composer install

#. Update the application configuration files to suit your local settings:
	
	* Set the "Application URL" in /app/config/app.php
	* Create a database and set the database connection details in /app/config/database.php
	* The organization name in /app/config/kblis.php

#. Run the migrations to create the required database tables::

	php artisan migrate

#. Load the basic seed data::

	php artisan db:seed

#. If you are running the application on a webserver eg. apache, ensure that the webserver has write permissions to the ``/app/storage`` folder. Ideally the web-root should be the ``/public`` folder. The default login credentials are '*administrator*' '*password*'

* If `#5 <https://github.com/ilabafrica/BLIS/issues/5>`_ or `#6 <https://github.com/ilabafrica/BLIS/issues/6>`_ above fails, you may need to run the following command then repeat the two commands again.

**Troubleshooting**

* Ensure that you enable mod_rewrite, ``sudo a2enmod rewrite`` if you are using apache. This should solve the problem of routing failures.
